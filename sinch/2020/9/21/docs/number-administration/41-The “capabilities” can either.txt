## Add numbers to an application (Overwrite)

This API overwrites all numbers assigned to your app with the new set of numbers that you specify.

> **Attention**
>
> When using this API method, any numbers that may already be configured for the particular application will be overwritten by the new list of numbers that you specify in this API call.

A new endpoint to only add a specific number to an application without overwriting the existing numbers will be available very soon.
