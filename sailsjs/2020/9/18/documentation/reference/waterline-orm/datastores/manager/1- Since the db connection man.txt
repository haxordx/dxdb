// Since the db connection manager exposed by `sails-mongo` is actually
// the same as the Mongo client's `db` instance, we can treat it as such.
var db = Pet.getDatastore().manager;

// Now we can do anything we could do with a Mongo `db` instance:
var rawMongoCollection = db.collection(Pet.tableName);
