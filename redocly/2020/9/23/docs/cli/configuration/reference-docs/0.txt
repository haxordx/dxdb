  pathInMiddlePanel:  false  # CE # show path link and HTTP verb in the middle panel instead of the right one.
  scrollYOffset: 0 # CE  # If set, specifies a vertical scroll-offset. This is often useful when there are
                   # fixed positioned elements at the top of the page, such as navbars, headers etc;
                   # scrollYOffset can be specified in various ways:
                   #  - number: A fixed number of pixels to be used as offset.
                   #  - css selector: selector of the element to be used for specifying the offset. The distance from the top of the page to the element's bottom will be used as offset.
                   #  - function (advanced): A getter function. Must return a number representing the offset (in pixels).

  showExtensions: false # CE  # show vendor extensions ("x-" fields). Extensions used by ReDoc are ignored.
                        # Can be boolean or an array of string with names of extensions to display.
